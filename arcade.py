'''
TO-DO:
-Calibrate buttons to do different things on different screens (button on game menu should pull up the question, button on the question menu should do something different)
-Change the grid on the game menu so that it shows buttons in the grid with the value of the questions displayed and the top row shows the categories
-Need to change the values of the questions to better fit the grid (we only need 5 of each value and it appears we have 10 100 value questions)
-Figure out how to have each question button call back to a specific question in our database (probably will need a question class)
-Could use a python version of an ERD (I cannot for the life of me remember what they're called lol)
-We either need to find a way to write text on top of a sprite or make a image for each of our questions so I can call those in (however making the images will make our database redundant so probaby having text on our sprites will be ideal)
-Might need another view so we can show the winner at the end
*I will add more here as I think of things our program is currently lacking.
